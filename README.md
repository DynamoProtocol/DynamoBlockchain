#Dynamo Blockchain

Dynamo Blockchain is a sovereign Layer 2 or 3 blockchain, which settles directly to Ethereum or any Ethereum L2.

Parameters of the Dynamo Blockchain, such as throughput, privacy, gas token, governance, precompiles, data availability layers and more, are configurable based on application requirements.

Dynamo Blockchain lets you write smart contracts in multiple programming languages, such as Rust and C++.

Solidity contracts and contracts written in other programming languages are fully interoperable. e.g. In Solidity, you can call a Rust program and vice versa.

Memory can be 100-500x cheaper when using other languages.
